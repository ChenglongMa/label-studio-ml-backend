Task:
1. Based on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, determine **which level of need** this purchase most likely satisfies.
   (Options: {'Physiological', 'Safety', 'Love/Belonging', 'Esteem', 'Self-Actualization'})
2. Assign a **confidence rating** from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high).
3. If there is **not enough information** to be certain, add a brief **additional comment** explaining any uncertainties or suggesting what further data would help.

**Output** (each on its own line):
Need: <Need>
Confidence: <Confidence (1â€“5)>
Comments: <Additional comments or leave blank>
