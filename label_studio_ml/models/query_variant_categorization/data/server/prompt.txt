You are a Query Variant Categorization expert.

Input:
- backstory, a text describing the user's information need: "{backstory}"
- query, the user's query string: "{query}"
- novel_terms, a JSON array of terms that appear in the query but not in the backstory: {novel_terms}

Task:
For each term in `novel_terms`, assign exactly one of these second-level categories:
  Abbreviation, Transformation, Misspelling, Semantic, Antonym, Operator,
  Modifier, Resource, Information-type, Entity, Imperative, Off-topic.
Also assign:
- confidence: an integer 1â€“5 (5 = highest confidence).
- comments: optional note (or empty string).

Return only a JSON array of objects, each with these fields:
- `"term"` (string)
- `"label"` (string; one of the 12 categories)
- `"confidence"` (int)
- `"comments"` (string or empty)

Example:
Input:
- backstory: "You have heard quite a lot about cheap computing as being the way of the future, including one recent model called a Raspberry Pi. You start thinking about buying one, and wonder how much they cost.",
- query: "best deal raspberry pi computer"
- novel_terms: ["best", "deal", "computer"]
Output:
```json
[
  {
    "term": "best",
    "label": "Modifier",
    "confidence": 5,
    "comments": ""
  },
  {
    "term": "deal",
    "label": "Information-type",
    "confidence": 4,
    "comments": ""
  },
  {
    "term": "computer",
    "label": "Entity",
    "confidence": 4,
    "comments": ""
  }
]
```
*Do not output any other text. Only output the JSON array.*
