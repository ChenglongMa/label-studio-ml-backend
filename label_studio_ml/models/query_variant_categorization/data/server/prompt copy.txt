Input:
- A **backstory** string describing an information need and context.
- A **query** string that is a user-generated question or request for information.
- A list of **novel terms** that appear in the query but do not appear in the backstory. These terms may include new concepts, modifications of existing concepts, or other relevant terms that reflect the user's understanding and information needs.

Task:
1. Read the backstory and the query carefully. Understand how human generate queries based on backstories.
2. Analyze the novel terms in the query, and understand their role in the context of the backstory.
3. Understand the definition of term variation categories of the taxonomy:
   - **Modification**: Refers to the substitution of terms from the backstory lexicon with equivalent terms from the user lexicon, aimed at adapting the context and relevance of the search query while maintaining the original need.
      - Categories:
        - **Abbreviation**: A shortened form of a term.
        - **Transformation**: A change in the form or structure of a term.
        - **Misspelling**: An incorrect spelling of a term.
        - **Semantic**: A change in meaning or context of a term.
        - **Antonym**: A term that has an opposite meaning.
        - **Operator**: A term that indicates a logical operation (e.g., AND, OR).
   - **Enrichment**: Refers to the incorporation of additional terms from the user lexicon to refine, expand, or elaborate on the search query, aimed at retrieving specific information needs.
      - Categories:
        - **Modifier**: A term that modifies the meaning of another term.
        - **Resource**: A term that refers to a source of information or material.
        - **Information-type**: A term that indicates a type of information (e.g., date, number).
        - **Entity**: A term that refers to a specific person, place, or thing.
        - **Imperative**: A term that indicates an action or command.
        - **Off-topic**: A term that is not relevant to the backstory.
5. Classify each novel term into one of the categories above, based on its role in the context of the backstory and query.
   - If a term modifies a backstory concept, classify it into one of the **Modification** categories.
   - If a term adds new information, classify it into one of the **Enrichment** categories.

6. Produce **only** a JSON object mapping each novel term to its category pair.
